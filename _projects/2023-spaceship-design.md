A product designed to seal and store partially consumed canned beverages. Developed as part of a semester-long engineering design course, the project encompassed full-cycle product development, including CAD modeling, design for manufacturing (DFM), design for assembly (DFA), and sustainability analysis. 

Key engineering highlights include injection-moldable threaded components, vacuum-formed lid geometry, custom assembly fixtures, and lifecycle carbon footprint optimization. The team produced multiple functional prototypes and evaluated the commercial and technical viability of the design.
